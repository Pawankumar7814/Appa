                    <p>Wicks have always been an important element for religious occasions and lighting diyas. These braided cotton threads that are used to hold flames for lamps have been widely produced in the temple town of Pattanam, Madurai, for years.
                        The concept of Appa revolves around bringing these hand-crafted wicks made by traditional wick-makers of Madurai to the rest of the world. What makes Appa wicks different from their competitors is its precise braiding techniques
                        that sustain the wick longer and burn durably with no soot.

                    <p>Each wick when used during holy rituals creates a feeling of peace and purity because of its non-toxic attributes and eco-friendly craftsmanship. These ceremonial wicks are popular amongst the devotees in Pattanam due to their high-quality
                        and unique physical aspects that consist of natural fibres and colours from plant pigments. Appa as a brand aims to make this collection of wicks accessible to all devotees around the world for a fulfilling spiritual experience.
